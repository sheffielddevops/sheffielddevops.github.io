# Our meetups

Our events are free to attend, and open to anyone regardless of experience or background

Our events start in the early evening allowing enough time for those that don’t work in Sheffield centre to get to the venue, and for those that do enough time to grab something to eat beforehand. There will be one or two slots on the evening, usually about 40 minutes each, covering the topics of technology, people and organisations. This could be in the form of a presentation, open space discussion, or series of lightning talks.

# Why attend?

Meetups are a great way to learn. This might be a new technology, or from the experiences of others. It’s also an opportunity to share your thoughts and find others that are having similar problems and solutions. You’ll also find out what Devops related projects and activities companies are doing in Sheffield. It might even lead to some interesting career options.

If you’re not comfortable talking with people you don’t know, you’re also more than welcome to come along and simply enjoy the talks.

# Tickets

Details of the next event will be published on this website at [/next](/next) as well as on our [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/sheffielddevops-9701562868) page. The meetups tend to be popular and that means that some people will miss out, so if you do have a ticket and can’t make it please cancel it so that it can go to a good home.

# Code of Conduct

Meetups are meant to be fun. People from different social backgrounds, industries and technologies attend, so when you are talking to people please consider what you say and how you speak. Basically, be nice, be friendly, and be respectful. Our full Code of Conduct is available at [/code-of-conduct](/code-of-conduct).
