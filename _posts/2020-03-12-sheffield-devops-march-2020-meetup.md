### Building a new government service: devops in a small multidisciplinary team

Hive IT has been working with the Department for Education on delivering a new service for the dissemination of statistics through discovery, alpha and into a soon to launch public beta.

In this talk we’ll look at the challenges, successes and lessons learnt from developing a new service with a small team, and how adopting some of the devops principles has enabled fast iterations in response to user research and feedback.

Working for somebody else means you don’t always have full autonomy over your toolsets, we’ll look at how technology choices have been influenced, informed and changed over the course of development. Expect a lot of Azure from databases to devops, why you don't need to have Kubernetes and how to compromise between the perfect solution and the one that’s good enough to get the job done.
