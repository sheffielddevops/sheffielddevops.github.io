The next Sheffield Devops event takes place on Thursday 8th February and is generously sponsored and hosted by CMS, with food and beers, wines and soft drinks provided on arrival.

Following on from our Agile collaboartion in January we’re going for two tech talks in February.

Event opens at 6pm for food and drinks, with the first talk starting at 6:30pm.

- 6:00 - 6:30: Doors open
- 6:30 - 7:15: Matt Jarvis - “Mesos & DCOS”
- 7:15 - 7:30: Break
- 7:30 - 8:15: Simon Fisher: “Modernize your development workflow with Habitat”

About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Matt Jarvis, providing an intro to Mesos and DC/OS and why we need distributed orchestration systems.

Apache Mesos is a distributed system for running other distributed systems, often described as a distributed kernel. It’s in use at massive scale at some of the worlds largest companies like Apple, Netflix, Uber and Yelp. DC/OS is an open source distribution of Mesos, which adds all the functionality to run Mesos in production across any substrate, both on-premise and in the cloud. In this talk, I’ll introduce both Mesos and DC/OS and talk about how they work under the hood, and what the benefits are of running these new kinds of systems for emerging workloads.

Bio

Matt Jarvis is a Developer Advocate at Mesosphere, engaging with the communities around DC/OS and Mesos. Matt has spent more than 15 years building products and services around open source software, on everything from embedded devices to large scale distributed systems. Most recently he has been focused on the open cloud infrastructure space, and in emerging patterns for cloud native applications.

The second talk will be by Simon Fisher:

“Habitat is an open-source project by Chef that enables you to ship your application, to any platform, along with all the automation you’ll need to manage it in production. In this talk, we’ll look at creating the habitat plan, building packages, exporting to common container platforms, and running the habitat packages in their own process management supervisor. You’ll learn the steps to create repeatable, portable application environments for your applications from a clean room environment to running them in production.”
