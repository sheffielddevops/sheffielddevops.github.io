Roll up, roll up, the first Sheffield Devops Meetup is taking place on Thursday the 11th February 2016. We’ll be at Union Street from 6:30pm onwards for an evening of devops discussion:

- 6:30 - 7:00 Doors open&nbsp;  
- 7:00 - 7:15 Welcome talk  
- 7:15 - 7:45 Robert Ashton - An Introduction to DevOps in Microsoft Azure  
- 7:45 - 8:00 Break  
- 8:00 - 8:45 Andy Burgin - Everything you ever wanted to know about Devops but were afraid to ask  
- 8:45 onwards - to a local hostelry  
<!-- more -->

On the night we’ll have two great talks, firstly Robert Ashton will be sharing some hands-on experiences of deploying and managing services in Microsoft Azure. We’ll then be joined by Andy Burgin from Leeds Devops who will be explaining what Devops is and where it came from, covering LEAN and CAMS definitions he’ll explain why the Austin Allegro has more to do with devops than any of the latest and greatest technologies and tools.
