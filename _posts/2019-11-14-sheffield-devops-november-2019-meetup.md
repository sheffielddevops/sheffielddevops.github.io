## About the Speakers

### How We Accelerated Our Vault Adoption With Terraform

"When we first started with Vault for secret management, we were the all powerful admins doing everything manually. This was an audit nightmare, and with increasingly more users, our workload became unmanageable. We could not let that stand. We have the word "Automation" in our job titles, after all. In this talk, I will outline how we started chipping away at the manual processes, keeping track of changes over time, and automating parts of our configuration. And I will show you where we are today, with Pull Requests, ChatOps, and Terraform. While our specific pipeline is not going to be the best for everyone, I hope you come away from this talk with ideas for how to manage your own Vault clusters.

Lucy Davinhart is an automation engineer at Sky Betting & Gaming, meaning their job is to maintain internal platforms and services (e.g. Vault), finding ways to do things manually as infrequently as possible, and supporting their internal customers using some of the HashiCorp toolset. Lucy is a non-binary trans woman. In their spare time, when not catching up on Netflix, they fiddle around with silly coding projects, sometimes live on the Internet where everyone can see their typos."

### Something old, something new; Integrating legacy desktop systems with a modern AWS Cloud platform

"IRIS Software Group is the UK’s largest privately held software company serving over 650,000 SMEs,  21,000 accountancy firms and over 11,000 schools through our 16 office locations across the country.  12 months ago we embarked on an ambitious journey to modernise the IRIS software portfolio through a cloud based platform support a broad range of microservices.  This talk will explore some of the challenges in lifting this project off paper and into the cloud!"
