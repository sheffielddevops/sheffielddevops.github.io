## About the Speakers

About the Speakers

### The first talk will be by David McKay (@rawkode) who is coming all the way down from Glasgow to present this talk. David is a Developer Advocate for InfluxData, the company behind InfluxDB.

As a serial user group organiser, Cloud Native advocate, and lover of esoteric programming languages, David is always on the hunt to learn and share knowledge with others in fun and exciting ways.

### The Telegraf Toolbelt: It can do that, really?

Telegraf is an agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics.

With over 200 plugins, Telegraf can fetch metrics from a variety of sources, allowing you to build aggregations and write those metrics to InfluxDB, Prometheus, Kafka, and more.

In this talk, we will take a look at some of the lesser known, but awesome, plugins that are often overlooked; as well as how to use Telegraf for monitoring of Cloud Native systems.

The second talk will be by our very own Oliver Leaver-Smith from Sky Betting & Gaming:

You Did What?! The (condensed) story of why using the wrong tool for the job is sometimes the right thing to do.

The company is ready to move to a cloud-first, container-focused way of working. It's the Devops dream come true. Except we don't have a cloud platform to put these new containers on, and no expertise in creating one, and then there is the small matter of licensing restrictions stopping us from using any public cloud provider not based on an island in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy. Oh, and another area of the business might just be investing a lot of R&D resource into creating a shared Kubernetes platform.Where did we come from? Where are we now? What does the future hold? What's it like to work on a project without mammoth scope creep? The answers to most of these questions will be revealed.
