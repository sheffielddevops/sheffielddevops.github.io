About the Speakers

Dan Finneran from Docker

“Docker/Containers, 999:  
This normally would be a 101, but in this session we’ll be exploring the basics of containers to scaling out applications with orchestrators and everything in between. Starting with the Docker engine (including internals), to composing your application and finally deploying in a working environment. Feel free to bring a laptop to be involved (Docker for {OS} pre-installed), and come armed with questions!”

Simon Thurman - Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft

Azure DevOps - A look at DevOps tools in the public cloud. Simon will be talking us through the recently announced “Azure Devops” tooling ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/introducing-azure-devops/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/introducing-azure-devops/))
