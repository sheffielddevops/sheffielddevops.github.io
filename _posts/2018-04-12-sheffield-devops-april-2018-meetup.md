About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Oliver Leaver-Smith - Engineered Chaos: Breaking Prod and Getting Away With It

“A whistle stop tour of chaos engineering and disaster recovery testing. We’ll cover what they are and how some of the big names in tech use the principles to make things better by breaking them. The talk will also give an insight into how Sky Betting and Gaming use the principles of chaos and DR testing to improve both our services and our incident response.”

The second talk will be by Jon Topper from The Scale Factory who will be discussing how Boring Is Powerful.

“People often think of boredom as a bad thing: I’ll argue that in systems design and operations, it can actually be a virtue. Boredom is the motivation that leads us to automate the things we find ourselves doing frequently.

Software, frameworks or services that are “boring” often seem that way because they’re predictable, reliable and trustworthy. Bored is the ideal state for an on-call engineer.

I’ll make the case that we should ration our excitement, saving it for the things that differentiate us from the competition.”
