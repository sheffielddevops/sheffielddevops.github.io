About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Bobby Devaux - Using Kubernetes Secrets within OpenShift

Bobby delivered a great container talk for us in the Spring of this year and now he’s back, this time focusing on using Secrets within the OpenShift platform.

The second talk will be by Rory Gibson, a developer, sometime CTO, consultant and, recently, startup founder.

For the last 9 months Rory has been splitting his time between consulting on agile and DevOps adoption in the public sector, and starting a side project / startup called CTX, a search product for digital teams that helps them get control of their data in cloud based tools ( [https://getctx.io](https://getctx.io) )

The talk is entitled “DevOps for a Dummy” and will be a case study in applying the basics of the techniques we know and love in a greenfield startup environment with a very small team (1 person!).

Expect to hear about

- Ansible  
- Simple and effective Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery setups  
- Choosing a cloud provider without just plumping for AWS as the easy option  
- Security in the cloud when you’re not on AWS.  
- Quick, dirty and effective monitoring and alerting

Sponsors

Affecto Recruitment

This month we are proudly sponsored by [Affecto Recruitment](http://www.affecto.co.uk/)

At Affecto Recruitment, our consultants are dedicated to supporting clients and candidates across Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire’s booming digital and technology sector.

Part of what drives us is our commitment to promoting just that, whilst tackling what we believe is a ‘perception only’ talent shortage in the area, and it’s this approach that has helped us establish an unrivalled reputation for connecting exceptional individuals with exceptional organisations.

Investing heavily in our own ongoing development, we consider ourselves to be ‘in the know’ when it comes to the latest technological advances. Insight that means the businesses we partner with can rely on us for informed market intelligence in talent requirements, as well as wider issues that could impact their organisation.

CMS (formally Nabarro LLP)

Like the Sheffield DevOps team, we want Sheffield to be the UKs next big technology hub, attracting the best tech businesses and talent from across the UK and beyond, and encouraging innovation. Supporting organisations like Sheffield DevOps is a vital part of this strategy and we are very much looking forward to working with both in order to achieve our common goal.”_ For more information on CMS’s technology focus click here:
