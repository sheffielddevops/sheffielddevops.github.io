## **About the Speakers**

### **Andy Burgin**

Andy is Lead Platform Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming. He considers himself a Kubernetes and Hadoop fettler, spending a far too much of his spare time making Raspberry Pis do things they shouldn't. He was a small part of the organising team for DevOpsDays London 2019 and has been running the Devops meetup in Leeds for 6 years hosting over 40 events. He's attended and spoke at a bunch of DevOps conferences and in his own words is 'an all round DevOps nuisance'.

**Beyond Dashboards - Visualising Complex Systems**

There are many ways to collect and visualise metrics from Kubernetes clusters. Many of us collect metrics and visualise them on dashboards. The plethora of graphs and charts enable us to quickly spot anomalies with workload or cluster performance. However do we really understand the workloads that run on our clusters? this can be a challenge particularly in a multi-tenant environment.

This session will demonstrate ways to "see" the workloads running on clusters, helping to better understand workloads through visualisation, anomaly identification and exploratory analysis. Using tools such as graph databases and visualisation tools, you'll learn how they can help you explore and understand cluster workload topology usage. Sharing examples of how these tools have identified issues and how they can help engage with tenants to share best practices and ultimately improve cluster performance.

### **Speaker Two TBC**
