## About the Speakers

### The first talk will be by Paul Ridgway from The Curve Consulting 

Paul has written a series of blog posts discussing how he configured a low cost monitoring system using a number of Raspberry Pi's over at https://blockdev.io/ and he'll be bringing this to life in the first talk of the evening.

### The second talk will be by Sam Smith from the Gaming Tribe at Sky Betting and Gaming

Site Reliability Engineering: Not just for the global scale

- What is site reliability engineering (SRE) and how does it relate to DevOps?
- Why would you want to use SRE methods?
- How can we take these methods and implement them?

We will give a brief overview of what reliability engineering is and how it is different from "DevOps" along with some of the main pillars of SRE practices. Next we will jump into a ongoing story of attempting to implement these practices at a non global scale (we're not all Google).

This will touch on monitoring practices, incident response and post mortems and their place in the Service Reliability Hierarchy. We will relate this paper exercise to reality, what tools do we use and why? Which of these have worked well and which haven't. Expect a story or two of unfortunate DevOps accidents and how they could have been avoided with different practices and mindsets.

Finally we will talk about how you can start to organise cultural change in your own teams, attempting to get cross business buy in and change working practices for the better in your own work place.

Sam is a Reliability Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming, his interests include graphs, data stores and not having to turn things off and on again at 02:00 whilst on call.
