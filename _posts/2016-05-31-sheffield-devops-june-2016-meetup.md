Back by popular demand, the next Sheffield Devops Meetup is taking place on Thursday the 9th June 2016 and is kindly sponsored and hosted by [G2G3 Digital](http://g2g3.digital/ "G2G3 Digital"). Tickets are available now at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sheffield-devops-june-2016-meetup-tickets-25787311543#tickets).

We’ll be at the G2G3 Digital’s office over at Velocity House from 6:30pm onwards for an evening of devops discussion:

- 6:30 - 7:00 Doors open and drinks/food provided
- 7:00 - 7:05 Welcome talk
- 7:05 - 7:45 TBC
- 7:45 - 8:00 Break
- 8:00 - 8:45 Glen Mailer - “Have you heard of the 12 factors?”  
- 8:45 onwards - to a local hostelry

About the Speakers:

Headlining will be by Glen Mailer, with Have you heard of the 12 factors?

“These set of simple principles were originally written up by engineers at heroku in 2011, writing software that follows them is a great way to avoid lock-in by writing scalable independent services that are easy to apply devops-style thinking and processes to. I think anyone involved in designing, writing or deploying software should at least be aware of them, and if you’re not following any of them: know why. I’ll walk us all through what the principles are, and why they’re useful.”

Our other slot is still TBC. After the success of the discussion following on from Gwen’s talk last month we’re considering whether a similar interactive piece might make a nice change from our usual two talk format. We’ll be finalising plans this week so let us know if this is something you would like to see or be involved in?
