## About the Speakers

### The first talk will be by Tom Hoyland - Agile Delivery Lead at SBG 

How would you build a team from scratch? What techniques would you use? What metrics should you respond to?

In this talk you’ll see how we assembled a team, embedded agile values, a DevOps mindset and a clear purpose to create a squad with an infectious, high performing culture.

We’ll demonstrate the coaching and visualisation techniques we used to reduce batch size and improve quality. You’ll see how to reveal ‘hidden’ product backlogs, make the invisible visible, and use domain driven design, theory of constraints and language to optimise team resilience.

Bio:
With a background in software engineering, product development and service transformation, Tom likes to get under the bonnet of products and teams to understand what makes them tick and how they could be better.

He’s led a range of agile and digital transformations, working with organisations to develop high performing, resilient cultures that go on to create innovative products and services.

A host of Agile Sheffield and regular speaker at agile and DevOps meetups, Tom likes to tell the stories of teams and their journeys, weaving together case studies, research, insights and metrics.

### The second talk will be by Will Marshall and Rachael Morgan – Infrastructure Engineering Managers at SBG

Imposter Syndrome, the beast within... ‘Most people experience it, for some it lasts a moment and for others a lifetime. It affects all genders, all ethnicities and people up and down the career ladder. Having explored the issue we want to take you through what we have found and some practical ways that you can battle the beast and win.’
