About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Luke Roberts:

“Convox utilizes open source tooling and the incredible AWS and Docker toolchain to provide a robust, powerful, flexible yet developer friendly Devops experience. This talk will highlight both how Convox is designed and how we have utilized Golang and the open source community to achieve it. We will also discuss how we have achieved PCI/HIPPA compliance at scale without sacrificing the developer experience

There will be a demo and a Q and A, people are also encouraged to bring their own laptops and dockerized apps. I’d love to help you get started on your journey with Convox”

The second talk will be by Amanda Cookson from Northern Value Creators:

“Amanda is fascinated by what’s going on in our brains and how that impacts our ability to think and work smart when part of a busy team. Amanda reckons understandings from neuroscience added to coaching techniques can help teams be better in situations where there is a lot of effort involved, and lots of pressure - a lethal combination that hampers smart thinking.

Join Amanda as she explores the brain, offering insights to help us understand what’s going in high pressure situations.”
