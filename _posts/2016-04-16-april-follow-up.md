Thanks to everyone who came on Thursday - it’s great to have your continued support. Once again a huge thanks to our speakers too, and finally to Nabarro for their continued support and hospitality; that was some spread they put on for us!

Marcus has asked me to share the following feedback link for any comments (+ve or -ve) on Microsoft and DevOps: [http://](http://aka.ms/devopsug)[aka.ms/devopsug](http://aka.ms/devopsug)

He’s also provided the following links to some Microsoft technical resources:   
\* DevOps Fundamentals: [https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/DevOps-Fundamentals](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/DevOps-Fundamentals)

\* DevOps Dimensions : [https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/DevOps-Dimension](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/DevOps-Dimension)

\* Get access to free online training: [https://mva.microsoft.com/training-topics/devops](https://mva.microsoft.com/training-topics/devops)

As well as the code he used in the session: &nbsp;[https://](https://github.com/marrobi/InfrastructureToAzure/tree/Sheffield-DevOps-14th-April)[github.com/marrobi/InfrastructureToAzure/tree/Sheffield-DevOps-14th-April](https://github.com/marrobi/InfrastructureToAzure/tree/Sheffield-DevOps-14th-April)
