The next Sheffield Devops is a joint event with [Agile Sheffield](https://www.meetup.com/Agile-Sheffield-Meetup/events/244862268 "Agile Sheffield").

The event takes place on Thursday 25th January 2018 and is generously sponsored and hosted by The Workstation, with nibbles and drinks provided on arrival.

For the last couple of events we’ve had a DBA theme and a join event with ShefTest for a Testing theme - this month it’s an Agile theme in collaboration with our friends at Agile Sheffield. &nbsp;We want our audience to understand and discuss the commonality and relationships between Agile and DevOps.

We’re continuing the earlier starts of 6pm food, 6:30pm first talk.

- 6:00 - 6:30: Doors open 
- 6:30 - 7:15: What is Agile? &nbsp;What is DevOps? How do they overlap and interact?
- 7:15 - 7:30: Break
- 7:30 - 8:15: Agile DevOps Discussions - see below…

NOTE: Please only sign up either here or at Meetup, don’t sign up on both event pages…
