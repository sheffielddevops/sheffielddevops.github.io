Back by popular demand, the next Sheffield Devops Meetup is taking place on Thursday the 14th April 2016. We’ll be at a central place in Sheffield (venue TBC) from 6:30pm onwards for an evening of devops discussion:

- 6:30 - 7:00 Doors open and drinks/food provided
- 7:00 - 7:05 Welcome talk
- 7:05 - 7:45 Marcus Robinson: Automated deployment of Infrastructure to Microsoft Azure
- 7:45 - 8:00 Break
- 8:00 - 8:45 Claire Agutter: Putting the Ops in DevOps – using IT service management to gather feedback and improve flow
- 8:45 onwards - to a local hostelry

About the Speakers:

The first talk will be by Marcus Robinson, a Technical Evangelist for Microsoft. In this talk he will be discussing how inconsistencies in infrastructure configuration in the release pipeline can lead to unforeseen issues. In this demonstration filled session we will discuss why a consistent infrastructure environment is vital in enabling continuous delivery and reducing unplanned work.

We will focus on three key DevOps practices:  
· Infrastructure as Code  
· Configuration Management  
· Release Management

Which will be demonstrated using:  
· Azure Resource Manager Templates  
· PowerShell Desired State Configuration and Azure Automation DSC  
· Visual Studio Team Services Release Management

The second talk will be by Claire Agutter, discussing how DevOps and ITIL can work together. &nbsp;As DevOps gets more popular and delivers measurable results, traditional IT service management organisations are starting to look at it more closely. How can DevOps and ITIL work together? How does agile thinking affect traditional IT service management areas like change management, the help desk and IT support? And can ITIL contribute to DevOps? In this presentation, Claire Agutter will discuss how enterprise organisations can use their existing IT service management processes in a more agile way, and give attendees some takeaways to consider for their own IT organisation.

Speaker bio: Claire Agutter is the director of ITSM Zone, providers of high quality e-learning for IT professionals. &nbsp;Claire uses her background in service management operations and consultancy to blend old and new best practice to give organizations the toolkit they need to deliver business value. &nbsp;From ITIL to DevOps, BRM and Agile Service Management, Claire believes in sharing knowledge and experience between organizations and hosts the popular ITSM Crowd hangouts that provide practical advice to professionals around the world.
