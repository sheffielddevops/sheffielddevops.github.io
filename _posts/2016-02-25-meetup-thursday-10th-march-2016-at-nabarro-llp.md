Back by popular demand, the second Sheffield Devops Meetup is taking place on Thursday the 10th March 2016. We’ll be at Nabarro LLP, Victoria Quays from 6:30pm onwards for an evening of devops discussion:

- 6:30 - 7:00 Doors open and drinks/food provided
- 7:00 - 7:05 Welcome talk
- 7:05 - 7:45 Simon Fisher - Cooking up a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Chef
- 7:45 - 8:00 Break
- 8:00 - 8:45 Mark Crossfield - “What we learned whilst handing control of deployments to developers at Auto Trader”
- 8:45 onwards - to a local hostelry

**About the Speakers:**

The first talk will be by Simon Fisher, a Solution Architect for Chef. In this talk he will be demonstrating how Chef capabilities can enable Continuous Delivery. Building on the solid foundation and success of open source Chef, Simon will demonstrate some of the broader product set that incorporates new features around delivery pipelines and compliance. This session is aimed at all levels, from those who haven’t heard of Chef to seasoned professionals and will incorporate a demo of the products.

The second talk will be by Mark Crossfield, an organiser of DevOps Manchester, who will be sharing some experiences of "What we learned whilst handing control of deployments to developers at Auto Trader”. In 2015 Auto Trader reached a milestone in their release automation journey by handing over control of application deployments to delivery squads. &nbsp;

This was the culmination of a nine month project, two years of loose discussion and years of previous automation - but the journey does not end there. We’ll cover the context in which the project was carried out, the approach was taken & what was learned along the way. This talk is intended to appeal to all levels of technical knowledge.
