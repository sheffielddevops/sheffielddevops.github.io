About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Dan FInneran(@thebsdbox/[thebsdbox.co.uk/](http://thebsdbox.co.uk/)), EMEA Software Defined Solutions Architect for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. His current role primarily focuses on integrations between HPE products and open source technologies such as Chef and Docker, and in this talk he will cover the two new projects from Docker:

“Docker LinuxKit and InfraKit"

It will feature examples and demonstrations of:

- Building an Operating System and Applications as code  
- Packaging that Operating System and uploading to on-prem or to the cloud  
- Deploying, Scaling, Healing and Destroying instances of that new OS/App.

The second talk will be by Matthew Skelton from Skelton Thatcher Consulting.

Matthew Skelton has been building, deploying, and operating commercial software systems since 1998. Co-founder and Principal Consultant at Skelton Thatcher Consulting ([http://skeltonthatcher.com/](http://skeltonthatcher.com/)), he specialises in helping organisations to adopt and sustain good practices for building and operating software systems: Continuous Delivery, DevOps, aspects of ITIL, and software operability.

Matthew curates the well-known DevOps team topologies patterns at [devopstopologies.com](http://devopstopologies.com/) and is co-author of the books Continuous Delivery with Windows and .NET (O’Reilly, 2016) and Team Guide to Software Operability (Skelton Thatcher Publications, 2016).

How and Why to Design your Teams for Modern Software Systems.

For effective, modern, cloud-connected software systems we need to organise our teams in certain ways. Taking account of Conway’s Law, we look to match the team structures to the required software architecture, enabling or restricting communication and collaboration for the best outcomes.

This talk will cover the basics of organisation design, exploring a selection of key team topologies and how and when to use them in order to make the development and operation of your software systems as effective as possible. The talk is based on experience helping companies around the world with the design of their teams.
