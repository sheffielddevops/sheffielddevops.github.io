About the Speakers

The first talk will be by

Craig Stewart:

“Our journey from Redis 2 to Redis 3 at scale - while not taking the site down!”

We have recently embarked upon a process of upgrading our Redis servers, to enable the use of the native clustering features available from Redis 3.2. This talk explains why we’re using clustering, what problems we have encountered along the way, and what our solutions have been while trying to support more than 20,000 people logging in within a single minute.

The second talk will be by Alex Yates:

“DevOps 101 for data professionals – how your jobs will change”

In 2009 John Allspaw and Paul Hammond changed the way millions of people would think about  
software delivery for years to come. DevOps was born.  
In 2013 Kenny Gorman declared “The DBA is Dead”. (I don’t believe that, but others do.)  
What is DevOps? Where did it come from? How do data folk stay relevant?
