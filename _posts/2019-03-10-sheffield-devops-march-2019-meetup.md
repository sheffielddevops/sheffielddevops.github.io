## About the Speakers

### The first talk will be by Pauline Narvas (DevOps Graduate @ EE)

Pauline is a passionate multi-hyphenate - a person with a hyphenated profession. She is a self-taught developer, a speaker, and a community builder. She has been documenting stuff on the internet since 2008 and is now working in DevOps with EE, as well as a remote developer. She is on a mission to live her healthiest, happiest life. Her areas of interest include tech, the digital world, health and personal development.

Pauline will be talking about the importance of diverse teams, using stories of how much of an impact this has had in her career so far and ways that we can together improve diversity and inclusion of the technical workforce.

### The second talk will be by Claire Agutter (ITSM professional & Chief Architect for VeriSM)

Claire joined us for one of our early Sheffield Devops events, way back in April 2016. This month she’s back to talk about VeriSM - a modern approach to IT Service Management:

“[VeriSM](https://verism.global/) is an approach to help organisations deliver digital services in a time when the pressure to deliver value has never been higher. VeriSM is not a new product that competes with frameworks and methodologies like DevOps, Agile and ITIL; instead it’s a way to analyse them and place them in context. VeriSM is about taking a step back, looking at the problems you have, the methods you currently use and then rethinking and evolving your approach.

VeriSM stands for Value-driven, Evolving, Responsive, Integrated Service Management. It helps organisations respond to the recent proliferation of management practices, frameworks and standards by giving them a way to select what they need to meet their goals.“
