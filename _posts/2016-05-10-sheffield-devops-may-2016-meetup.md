About the Speakers:

The first talk will be by Gwen Diagram who has stepped in at the last minute to save our bacon! She’s offering us a choice of talks; “Your Ops Team Grumpy?” or “Is Test Causing Your Live Problems” which we’re going to take to the wire and decide through a show of hands when we kick off the evening.

Headining will be by Phil Garner, a Lead DevOps Engineer at SkyBet UK on the topic of Preparing for and Surviving Grand National 2016 at Sky Betting and Gaming.

In this talk Phil will be running us through his experiences of the last few months, from spinning up a new team here in Sheffield, taking over operational responsibilities of critical pieces of the Skybet platform and finally how this was scaled out ready to cope with the tidal wave of traffic that is the Grand National.
