## **About the Speaker**

### **David Lockwood**

David is a Lead Engineer at Tutorful, writing code and solving problems to help make 1:1 tuition accessible to everybody.

He is particularly passionate about code reviews, how development teams work, CSS (don’t judge, it’s just fun!), good automated tests, and a nice abstraction.

When not writing code or in a meeting, he will be playing (yet another) round of Dragonwood with his children or driving them to a dance class.

## **The Talk**

When you have designed and built a distributed, scalable application and an alarm fires telling you that something that shouldn’t be a problem is a problem… what do you do?

A journey across the stack, from alert to resolution, via all the dead ends. Stops will be made in AWS, Redis and at a smattering of dashboards.
