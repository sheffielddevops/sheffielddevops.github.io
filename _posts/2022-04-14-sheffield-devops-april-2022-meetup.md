## **The Talk**

Being on call is tough. It affects your sleep, your wellbeing, and your personal life. Though the methods for waking engineers up have changed, a lot of the underlying parts of on call are still the same. Whether it's being called out for a disk space problem, or something stop the world critical, there are things that we can do to make the process of on call better and healthier. Dad of two and ex-publican-turned-technologist ols has spent many years calling people out, and being called out, and as such has really come to value sleep. Implementing some of the suggestions in this talk can really help you get paid to sleep. This is not a pyramid scheme.
