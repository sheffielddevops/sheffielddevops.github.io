About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Bernard Jauregui:

“How I learned to stop worrying and love the Cloud”

Cloud is great for running test automation and NFT, but it also hides pitfalls and weird side effects.

This talk is about Bernard’s time as a test lead, using AWS and Azure, for large scale performance testing. It covers five areas of concern and confusion, that most testers will encounter. He describes the challenges faced and how to overcome them.

Attendees will learn how to avoid common mistakes and build better test environments.

Here are five things not to worry about:

1. Where to start
2. Runaway costs
3. Stepping on toes
4. Weird outcomes
5. Effective tear-down

The second talk will be by Claire Johnstone & Phil Garner:

“Performance Testing on Production… why the hell not?”

At Sky Betting and Gaming we have many 24/7 products with 1.7 million active customers, and sometimes all happen to be playing at the same time. This means we have to cope with traffic loads of:   
- 44+ million game transactions per week  
- 50+ million content updates daily  
- peaks of 23k+ logins per minute, 16k+ bets per minute and 1 million active customers

We have over 1,300 production servers across a private and AWS estate with a minimum of 6.8 THz of compute available at any one time for our customers to hammer.

Come and find out why and how we test our systems to cope with these traffic loads over the last 2 years, taking our platform from coping with 400 logins per second to the current 1.4k logins per second all the way to our next target of 2k logins per second. We will tell you how we do it and more importantly all the mistakes we have made along the way (well only some of them - we are not the only talk of the evening!).
