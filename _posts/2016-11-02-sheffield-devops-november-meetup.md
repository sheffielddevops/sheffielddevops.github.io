About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Tom Hoyland who is currently based at Home Office Digital, Data and Technology here in Sheffield. “It’s all about people! It’s about how we’ve treat them in the past, the assumptions we’ve made along the way and how these have slowed our ability to deliver. It’s about how we treat people now, encourage more resilient teams and work together to ship great products!”

The second talk will be from Jamie Hinton, CTO and Founder of Razor Jam who are based in The Workstation. Jamie will be discussing some of the cool DevOps stuff that happens at RazorJam and will be focusing on how they’ve used Azure and other technology to enable them to quickly grow as a business.
