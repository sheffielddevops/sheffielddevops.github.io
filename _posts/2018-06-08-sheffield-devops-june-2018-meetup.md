The next Sheffield Devops event takes place on Thursday 14th June and is generously sponsored and hosted by CMS, with food and beers, wines and soft drinks provided on arrival.

Event opens at 6pm for food and drinks, with the first talk starting at 6:30pm.

- 6:00 - 6:30: Doors open 
- 6:30 - 7:15: Lightning talks from various people
- 7:15 - 7:30: Break
- 7:30 - 8:15: Agile Architecture - Andy Butcher

About the Speakers

The first session will be a series of lightning talks from Oliver-Leaver-Smith, Paul Brabban, James Cutts and anyone else that fancies a slot. &nbsp;Just let us know in advance.

Lightning talks will be on the topics of:

- Storing Secrets in DNS
- Opinionated CI and CD with Heroku
- Serverless

The second talk will be by Andy Butcher discussing Agile Architecture.

How can Architecture be Agile?  
Surely Architecture is about designing the big picture, and Agile is about incrementally building things as you go along? How can these two things be reconciled?

No TOGAF here!  
In this talk I’ll describe how Architecture can be done locally, and at scale, in way that’s lightweight, responsive, iterative, evolving, and continuous.

I hope to dispel the myth once and for all that there’s any conflict between Architecture and Agile, with practical advice and examples of how and why it works.
