About the Speakers

The first talk will be by Alexandra Carter, System Build Engineer, Callcredit and Marcus Robinson, Technical Evangelist, Microsoft:

“Let’s put this legacy solution into Docker Containers on Windows” said Callcredit. &nbsp;This is what happened…

Each deployment of Callcredit’s Numéro solution is bespoke configured and any updates need to be applied deliberately and specifically to the instance. This isn’t scalable as usage of the solution increases.

Callcredit need to be able to deploy the “next new client” into a hosted environment in an automated, repeatable and supportable way that meets the following requirements:

- portable (i.e. deployable onto Cloud providers or on a client’s premise)
- able to push an update once and for it to update many hosted instances
- able to quickly replicate a specific client configured instance of the solution
- methodology needs to be repeated for other products/solutions with the same deployment pattern

During this session we will tell the story of how Callcredit and Microsoft worked together to solve this challenge.

The second talk will be by Ramen Sen from NHS Digital:

Techniques in DevOps adoption and embedding culture at NHS Digital/HSCIC. What we achieved, how we got there, and the issues we faced.

How NHS Digital (then called HSCIC) have spread devops adoption across the organisation.

Discussion of some quite spectacular success stories, how devops adoption was achieved, what architecture was adopted, and the problems faced along the way.

Sponsors

Affecto Recruitment

This month we are proudly sponsored by [Affecto Recruitment](http://www.affecto.co.uk/)

At Affecto Recruitment, our consultants are dedicated to supporting clients and candidates across Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire’s booming digital and technology sector.

Part of what drives us is our commitment to promoting just that, whilst tackling what we believe is a ‘perception only’ talent shortage in the area, and it’s this approach that has helped us establish an unrivalled reputation for connecting exceptional individuals with exceptional organisations.

Investing heavily in our own ongoing development, we consider ourselves to be ‘in the know’ when it comes to the latest technological advances. Insight that means the businesses we partner with can rely on us for informed market intelligence in talent requirements, as well as wider issues that could impact their organisation.
