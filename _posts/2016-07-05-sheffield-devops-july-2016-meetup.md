Back for our last event before taking a summer break, the next Sheffield Devops Meetup is taking place on Thursday the 14th July 2016. We’ll be at Nabarro LLP from 6:30pm onwards for an evening of devops discussion:

- 6:30 - 7:00 Doors open and drinks/food provided
- 7:00 - 7:05 Welcome talk
- 7:05 - 7:45 Alastair Smith - “DevOps Thinking and the Lean Six Sigma Toolbox!”
- 7:45 - 8:00 Break
- 8:00 - 8:45 Paul Brabban - “An Introduction to Serverless Architecture with AWS Lambda”
- 8:45 onwards - to a local hostelry

About the Speakers:

The first talk will be by Alastair Smith, a Performance and Service Manager at Learndirect. Alastair has a background in performance and capacity, monitoring, testing and lean six-sigma process improvement.

“In this talk we’ll be sharpening a few of the tools in our Lean Six Sigma toolbox and shaping our DevOps thinking around continual process improvement.

As well as examining the softer side of tooling, we’ll be taking a brief look at the continuous delivery pipeline and the vast array of tools out there to ‘hopefully’ make our life a little easier.

So, watch out Muda, we’re tooled up and coming to get you!”

If you’d like to share your thoughts before attending the talk, then please feel free to get in touch using this [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/XL3FNCP) link. I’ll incorporate your feedback into the talk.“

The second talk will be by Paul Brabban, a Data Engineer for Sky Betting & Gaming’s International division. Paul has been implementing data processing pipelines using Lambda on AWS and in his talk he will take us through the concepts of serverless architecture and his experience of using the platform in the real world.
