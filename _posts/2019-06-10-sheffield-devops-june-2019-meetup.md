## About the Speakers

### The first talk will be a joint talk by James & Paul Ridgway - Running Ruby and Rails, purely serverless on AWS

A talk covering running basic ruby functions to a full-blown Rails site using AWS, Lambda and various serverless technologies to enable scalability and reduce costs. The talk will include a demo and, for anyone with an AWS account, the ability to follow along.

### The second talk will be by Andy Burgin from Sky Betting and Gaming.

Sky Betting and Gaming have been on a Devops journey since 2011. They've undertaken numerous "Devops Transformations" and learned that this is an ongoing program rather than a "Big Bang" initiative. As the company has restructured in to agile autonomous tribes and squads, they've identified and reused a number of patterns and techniques as they've evolved their ways of working. This talk aims to share those learnings. It looks at how team structures changed, the way work was managed, how they learned, how products/services are owned and how they can safely increase velocity. In addition to looking holistically at the whole company, the talk will focus on one case study of how the Container Platform Squad evolved from a small greenfield POC to be the platform of choice for many projects/products across the tribes. To conclude there will be a whistle stop tour of our Kubernetes infrastructure addressing why we made certain design decisions and challenges.

Andy is a Platform Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming. He considers himself a Kubernetes and Hadoop fettler, spending a far too much of his spare time making Raspberry Pis do things they shouldn't. He was a small part of the organising team for DevOpsDays London 2018 and has been running the Devops meetup in Leeds for 5 years hosting over 40 events. He's attended and spoke at a bunch of DevOps conferences and in his words is "an all-round DevOps nuisance".
